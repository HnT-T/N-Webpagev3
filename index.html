            <h2>Why I Made This Page</h2>
            <p>I wanted to create something special for you, something to remind you how much you mean to me. This page is just a small way to express all the feelings I have for you.</p>

        <!-- Special Moments Section -->
        <section id="h2">
            <h2>Special Moments</h2>
            <p>Everytime we spend time together is a special moment in my opinion. Each time is always a blast and I always fell happy and motivated for the rest of the day. Even as you know when my mom notices a sudden boost in my mood she knows that you had something to do with it.</p>
            <p>One of the most special moments this year was recently when you came to watch my presentation. I was very nervous but seeing you infront of me motivated me to bring out the best in me to show you what I was capable of and then later through the day you complimented how i looked in the formal and said some beautiful and encouraging words for me and I was over the moon that day.</p>
            <p>One of the other special moments and this one is closer to my heart to be honest was on tuesday 24/12/24 where we went on a walk together but this time we went towards "Haram" and bought chips to eat together and spent a lot of time just talking and discussing and that day you asked me how I find you cute and what I see in you which caused me to tell you about the poem that I wrote about you... and today is the day you get to read this poem as you will find it below. That day was perfect on many levels and I was just the happiest person that day as I got to spend it with noone other than you..</p>

        <section id="h2">
            <h2>How We’ve Grown</h2>
            <p>We have grown so much together. Our time together made me learn how to be more understanding aswell as have more patience and I trule believe you are worth all the patience and self improvement because you deserve someone who understands you and makes you feel comfortable and a person you can trust and slowly but surely I'm tryng to improve myself to become that person becuase I only want you.</p>

        <section id="poem">
            <h2>The Poem</h2>
            <p>When i see you, everything fades into the Background<br>
                Your long, curly hair, like soft waves in the wind<br>
                And those eyes..so deep, they seem to hold the entire<br>
                galaxies within them..they make the world seem a little<br>
                more magical. But it is not jus your beauty that captivates me.<br>
                It is the way you make everything feel lighter, the way<br>
                your smile brightens even my darkest days. You have this<br>
                quiet way of turning ordinary moments into something extraordinary.<br>
                Just being around you feels like the universe aligning.<br>
                I'm forver grateful for the warmth and joy you bring into my life.</p>
